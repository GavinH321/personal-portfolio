            <h2>Background & Experience</h2>
            <p>I started tinkering with computers when I was 7 and have been highly intrigued about tech ever since.
                I currently work as a Tier 2 Tech Support Agent for Concentrix where I troubleshoot a wide range of Apple
                products. I've also worked as a virtual assistant performing SEO analytics and tasks such as proofreading and co-writing for webpages.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Story</h2>
            <p>As a child I loved to fix pc and network issues for friends, family, and neighbors. I learned how to access routers
                when I was 13 and became obsessed with learning how they worked. I also set up security camera systems and configure the ports they would
                run on so you could access them on a browser. This lead me to creating Minecraft servers and creating mod menus for Playstation games.
                I then dove into the world of creating 3D graphics and animations for people's Youtube videos.
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>Family time is the most important way to spend my time. Other than that I love reading books and researching
                about new technologies and programming languages that I've yet to learn. Hiking, camping, and fishing are some of my
                other hobbies.
